## Overview
A SaaS application that generates original music using AI. The tool uses a state-of-the-art
music generation model to create songs from simple text descriptions, custom lyrics, or style prompts.
I have built a complete production-ready SaaS with user authentication, a credit-based payment system using Polar.sh,
and background processing queues to handle user load. All service used in this project are free, 
so you won't have to pay anything to follow along. I'll use tech stack such as Next.js 15, React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS,
ShadCN, BetterAuth, Polar, Python, FastAPI, Modal, Inngest, Neon, S3 on AWS, and more.
